# Simple Node.js TCP Server and Client 

A Lot of common web protocols include http, ftp, websockets and so on use TCP. So, it's good to have basic understanding of how TCP works. 

This project is a simple example which shows communication between a TCP server and client.

## Server

In this example, the server accepts connections and store all connections. Then, every time receive data it sends the data to
all connected clients.

## Client
In this example, the client connects to the server and send a message and then closes the connection.
